# Birdsong Recognition
The idea for this projec is to build a small webapp so that one can record bird songs/calls on the phone and have a trained model predict what bird it is. I'm hoping to use this to get quick feedback as I learn more about bird calls in my neighbourhood.

The dataset comes from the Kaggle competition: Cornell Birdcall Identification. There is the link: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition/data>.

The only 3 birds that can be identified are blue jay, black-capped chickadee and cardinal. The only file format supported is mp3 right now.
